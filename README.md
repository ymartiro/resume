**Security Analyst**

Performed security code review of Visa products. Code review activities include: source code review using static analysis tools like HP Fortify; manual code review to ensure that architectural and security requirements are in place.

Performed Risk Analysis. Reviewed and analyzed the test results for possible security risks and ensure coverage of the most sensitive, highest risk areas.

Prepared the security reports with corresponding recommendations for appropriate corrective actions for data security incidents. And ensured that appropriate data security procedures and products are implemented.

Environment: Java, JSP, Ajax, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tomcat, MongoDB, NodeJS

##California State University East Bay        September 2010 – October 2012

**Research Software Developer**

Performed evaluation of commercial web application vulnerability scanners, that included creation of a highly dynamic, intentionally vulnerable web application. The goal was to identify and compare strengths and weaknesses of crawling and penetration testing automation features of evaluated solutions.

Test bed web application implements real-life scenarios that imitate the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top Ten Security Risks that are presented in the wild.

Intentionally vulnerable web application details:

- The web application was designed to realistically simulate the steps a regular user goes through while using a dynamic web page and replicates the behavior of e-commerce website.
- The web application is a Java based application, deployed on Apache Tomcat Web Server with servlet/JSP engine.
It uses Oracle (MySQL is another implemented option) database management server to manage the data, JSP for the front-end with extensive use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and AJAX technologies.

For each type of attack from OWASP Top Ten list several vulnerabilities were implemented, including First Order SQL Injection (SQLI), Blind SQLI and Database Constants SQLI, Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Stored XSS and Dom-Based XSS, Clickjacking, Cross-Site Request Forgery(CSRF),  Broken Authentication, Insecure Direct Object Reference, Security Misconfiguration, Insecure Cryptographic Storage, Failure to Restrict SQL Access, Insufficient Transport Layer Protection (including insecure session cookie usage and logging in without SSL), Unvalidated Redirect and Forwarding.

Performed the extensive analysis of Web Application Vulnerability Scanners (Acunetix WVS and QualysGuard WAS) running results for each OWASP Top Ten vulnerability type.

Presented WAVS testing report to Acunetix WVS and QualysGuard WAS development teams to serve as a useful foundation on which to build more effective WAVS.

**Environment:** Java, JSP, Ajax, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tomcat, Oracle, MySQL, NetBeans
